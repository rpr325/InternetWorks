<h2>How the Internet Works: Domains and ICANN</h2>
<p>The Internet is a massive network spanning the globe with about 7 billion connected devices. Most of these devices contain information that can be queried using a browser. Information is accessed by typing in a Unique Resource Locator (URL) into the browser. Within the URL is the domain name. Since the network, that is the Internet, is made up of massive number of unique devices locating a specific device requires a specific and unique identifier.</p>
<h2>Domain Names</h2>
<p>Domain names are an important feature of the Internet as they allow users to access information from other devices connected to the Internet.
    “A domain name is the address where Internet users can access your website. Domain names are used for finding and identifying devices connected to the Internet. Computers use IP addresses, which are a series of numbers.”
    An example of an IP address is 192.032.7 which when typed into your browser pulls up the home page for ICANN (http://icann.org). Since words are easier to remember than a series of numbers domain names are used to make the Internet more accessible to users.
    A popular domain used constantly on the Internet is ‘Google’. The Google domain name is contained within the URL as see in the example below.</p>
    <p>http://www.google.com</p>
    <p>The URL is broken down as follows</p>
    <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item">http:// - hypertext transfer protocol, rules for communication, a common language for servers and devices</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">www – the host name (world wide web)</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">google – domain name hosted on a particular network</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">.com – top level domain, such as .com, .org, .net (no two domain names can be the same within a top-level domain)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As you can see domain names are very useful when locating the connected device(s) you are querying for information. When using the browser you see many examples of domain names from various top level domains. A few more examples are provided below.</p>
    <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item">http://www.redcross.org – Red Cross Website</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">http://www.bls.gov – US Bureau of Labor Statistics</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">http://www.microsoft.com – Microsoft Corporation</li>
    </ul>
<h2>ICANN – The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers</h2>
<p>Connecting to devices on the Internet takes a high level of coordination. It is not a straight shot from your device to the destination computer. In fact, the indirectness of everything is by design. There are a number of stops along the way, which will be revealed in this project.</p>
<p>Using your browser to call up information from a connected device requires making a request using a unique identifier. In this case an IP address is used, which is a unique series of numbers assigned to each device connected to the Internet. ICANN coordinates these unique identifiers across the world. Without this coordination we wouldn’t have on global internet.</p>
<p>“The role of ICANN is to oversee the huge and complex interconnected network of unique identifiers that allow computers on the internet to find one another.”
    Below is an example of how ICANN governs the registration and use of domain names. This includes the Domain System, which is crucial it ensuring the internet is an accessible system. ICANN also assist with how IP addresses are supplied to avoid repetition and serves as the central repository for IP addresses.</p>

        <figcaption class="figure-caption">ICANN provides universal resolvability, which means that wherever you are on the network that you receive the same predictable results when you access the network.</figcaption>
