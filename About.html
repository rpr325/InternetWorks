<h2>The Internet</h2>
<p>The internet is a massive distributed network of connected devices brewed in the labs of government and academia.</p>
<h3>A Brief History of the Internet</h3>
<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1564760290292-23341e4df6ec?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1950&q=80" class="img-fluid" alt="Courtesy Leon Seibert - Unsplash">
<p>Developed in the early 70’s as a project for the US government the internet took in its first breath. Authors Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn followed up on the ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) experiment to create a functioning network. Paul Baran initially set up to design a communication system that would withstand a nuclear attack. Cerf and Kahn built on the original experiment to create a distributed packet network. This is what we know as the Internet today.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>	Precursors	</h3>
    <ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item">	1844: Samuel Morse transmits the first electric telegraph message, eventually making it possible for people to send messages around the world in a matter of minutes.	</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">	1876: Alexander Graham Bell (and various rivals) develop the telephone.	</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">	1940: George Stibitz accesses a computer in New York using a teletype (remote terminal) in New Hampshire, connected over a telephone line.	</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">	1945: Vannevar Bush, a US government scientist, publishes a paper called As We May Think, anticipating the development of the World Wide Web by half a century.	</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">	1958: Modern modems are developed at Bell Labs. Within a few years, AT&T and Bell begin selling them commercially for use on the public telephone system.	</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>	1960s: Preparing for a global network	</h3>
    <ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item">	1964: Paul Baran, a researcher at RAND, invents the basic concept of computers communicating by sending "message blocks" (small packets of data); Welsh physicist Donald Davies has a very similar idea and coins the name "packet switching," which sticks.	</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">	1963: J.C.R. Licklider envisages a network that can link people and user-friendly computers together.	</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">	1964: Larry Roberts, a US computer scientist, experiments with connecting computers over long distances.	</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">	1960s: Ted Nelson invents hypertext, a way of linking together separate documents that eventually becomes a key part of the World Wide Web.	</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">	1966: Inspired by the work of Licklider, Bob Taylor of the US government's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) hires Larry Roberts to begin developing a national computer network.	</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">	1969: The ARPANET computer network is launched, initially linking together four scientific institutions in California and Utah.	</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>	1970s: The modern Internet appears	</h3>
    <li class="list-group-item">	1971: Ray Tomlinson sends the first email, introducing the @ sign as a way of separating a user's name from the name of the computer where their mail is stored.	</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">	1973: Bob Metcalfe invents Ethernet, a convenient way of linking computers and peripherals (things like printers) on a local network.	</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">	1974: Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn write an influential paper describing how computers linked on a network they called an "internet" could send messages via packet switching, using a protocol (set of formal rules) called TCP (Transmission Control Protocol).	</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">	1978: TCP is improved by adding the concept of computer addresses (Internet Protocol or IP addresses) to which Internet traffic can be routed. This lays the foundation of TCP/IP, the basis of the modern Internet.	</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">	1978: Ward Christensen sets up Computerized Bulletin Board System (a forerunner of topic-based Internet forums, groups, and chat rooms) so computer hobbyists can swap information.	</li>
    <br>
    <h3>	1980s: The Internet gives birth to the Web	</h3>
    <ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item">	1983: TCP/IP is officially adopted as the standard way in which Internet computers will communicate.	</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">	1982–1984: DNS (Domain Name System) is developed, allowing people to refer to unfriendly IP addresses (12.34.56.78) with friendly and memorable names (like google.com).	</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">	1986: The US National Science Foundation (NSF) creates its own network, NSFnet, allowing universities to piggyback onto the ARPANET's growing infrastructure.	</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">	1988: Finnish computer scientist Jarkko Oikarinen invents IRC (Internet Relay Chat), which allows people to create "rooms" where they can talk about topics in real-time with like-minded online friends.	</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">	1989: The Peapod grocery store pioneers online grocery shopping and e-commerce.	</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">	1989: Tim Berners-Lee invents the World Wide Web at CERN, the European particle physics laboratory in Switzerland. It owes a considerable debt to the earlier work of Ted Nelson and Vannevar Bush.	</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>	1990s: The Web takes off	</h3>
    <ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item">	1993: Marc Andreessen writes Mosaic, the first user-friendly web browser, which later evolves into Netscape and Mozilla.	</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">	1993: Oliver McBryan develops the World Wide Web Worm, one of the first search engines.	</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">	1994: People soon find they need help navigating the fast-growing World Wide Web. Brian Pinkerton writes WebCrawler, a more sophisticated search engine and Jerry Yang and David Filo launch Yahoo!, a directory of websites organized in an easy-to-use, tree-like hierarchy.	</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">	1995: E-commerce properly begins when Jeff Bezos founds Amazon.com and Pierre Omidyar sets up eBay.	</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">	1996: ICQ becomes the first user-friendly instant messaging (IM) system on the Internet.	</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">	1997: Jorn Barger publishes the first blog (web-log).	</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">	1998: Larry Page and Sergey Brin develop a search engine called BackRub that they quickly decide to rename Google.	</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">	1999: Kevin Ashton conceives the idea that everyday objects, and not just computers, could be part of the Internet. This idea is now known as the Internet of Things.	</li>
    </ul>
